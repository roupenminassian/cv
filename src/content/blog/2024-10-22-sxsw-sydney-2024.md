The evening before the hackathon kicked off, we gathered virtually on [Gathertown](https://www.gather.town/), attempting to form teams ahead of time. While the virtual team formation didn't quite pan out as expected, it set the stage for what would become an incredible hackathon experience.

Walking into the venue the next morning, something clicked instantly. Within moments, we had formed a team of four individuals, each bringing unique skills to the table. I was fortunate to have come prepared with an idea in mind – one that leveraged small-scale LLMs for simple conversations, making our execution path clear and achievable.

The hackathon was structured around 'bounties' – specific challenges that either addressed particular causes or showcased the best implementation of tools like Groq or Buildship. After evaluating our options, we aligned our solution with Groq's platform. Their API's simplicity, combined with our plan to build on Vercel/Next.js, made it a natural fit.

## Strategic Time Management

Time was our most precious resource. While some teams had begun their work the previous night, we were starting fresh with just 12 hours to develop a working solution and prepare a 3-minute presentation. This constraint led us to adopt a strategic approach.

## Our Sprint Methodology

We structured our day into 90-minute sprints, a decision that proved crucial to our success. This format:
* Maintained our momentum
* Provided regular checkpoints for questions and alignment
* Kept us focused on our core deliverables

A key aspect of our approach was assigning each team member as an "owner" of specific product features. This ownership model:
* Created clear responsibilities
* Enabled parallel development
* Fostered personal investment in the project's success

Beyond the technical achievements and strategic planning, what made this hackathon truly special was the sheer enjoyment of building something meaningful together. The energy in the room was electric, and the spirit of collaboration was palpable.

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to Groq for providing their powerful API and to the incredible team at Build Club for organizing this event at SXSW Sydney 2024. Their efforts created an environment where innovation could thrive and new connections could form. This hackathon wasn't just about building a product – it was about building relationships and pushing the boundaries of what we thought possible in just 12 hours.

The experience reminded me why I love being part of the tech community: the excitement of creation, the power of collaboration, and the joy of seeing ideas come to life. Here's to many more hackathons and the continuous spirit of innovation they foster.
