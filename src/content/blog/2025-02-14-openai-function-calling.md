TL;DR this is a plug debuing another passion project of mine.

[Enter something here]

But through this veil of showmanship, I've recognised an ever-growing disparity between big data and the social-impact communities that need them. 

Have you thought much about how often we're now relying on AI tools? A recent study by Microsoft researchers noted a drop in critical thinking skills due to their growing dependance on the likes of ChatGPT and Claude. However to me this paints and even more unsavoury picture, that we are now desperate to sacrifice our own automony for increased productivity and revenues. 

In many cases, this also speaks volumes to our increasing dependence on pace in an enterprise setting:

- How fast can we ship this product?
- How quickly can we scale?
- How soon can we see revenue gains for our investors?

Of course, I am under the impression that this is good bread and butter for our society - one that oozes creativity and disruption. But as alluded to earlier, social enterprises - or at least organisations that try to primarily focus on social impact - taste more of the burnt edges. For these businesses to survive, are they looking for middle ground betwen social perfectionism and a profiteering? 

Where do they draw the line, and what is sacrificed to get there? It's a balancing act of the right ingredients that I'm just not seasoned enough with.

This sort of notion even trickles down to behaviours amongst individuals:

- How many projects can I build to showcase my skills and score an interview at [insert company here]?
- How much money can I make / time can I save on this contract?

You can now understand why I'm a bit fearful of pace. Sure I'm a bit cynical but these are all logical points, no?

Anyway, the reason why I'm thinking about this
